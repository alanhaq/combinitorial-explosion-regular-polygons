# Combinitorial-explosion-regular-polygons
#### This program utilizes multiple pruning methods to efficiently solve the following puzzle: 
There exist n+1 regular polygons with n sides, each a permutation of the n numbers on each side. The problem is to arrange the polygons in a ring with one in the center, such that the numbers on each adjacent edge will match. As shown in the below version, there are 7 pieces, each with 6 possible rotations, and hexagons tile the plane. But we can generalize. 4 triangles would fold up to a pyramid, 5 squares give you 5/6ths of a cube, 6 pentagons give you a bowl, and so on. Each puzzle will be randomly generated varying in number and orientation.

### Example of a hexagonal puzzle:
